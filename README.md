# Running Coursee
Install yarn first to package the project

Because this dynamic website does not have a domain associated with it, just download it, cd into it, and type 'yarn add next as well as yarn dev into the terminal:

```
yarn add next
yarn dev
```
Built with React, React-bootstrap, firebase (and nodeJS documentation), SurveyJS, Typescript, HTML, CSS, NPM, Yarn, NextJS <3

share this online with ```cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000``` (for me only lol)
or
```./ngrok http http://localhost:3000```

 TODO
//check if email is already registered, if so, notify at signup, maybe also if login is bad, once user has completed survey, take away option from dash

// ALSO create admin role with elevated privileges to input classes
// implemenation idea: check if user has a certain ID token, if so, give access to them by their token

//make the buttons on index cards with reactbootstrap
